# EDA
Iris Dataset Analysis 

This project loads and explores the Iris dataset using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. It prints dataset details (shape, columns, head, info, describe) and visualizes the data with scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

*Key Insights:

-Species form clear clusters, especially setosa.

-Petal measurements separate species better than sepal measurements.

-Minor outliers appear mainly in sepal width.
